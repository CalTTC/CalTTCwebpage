          <p>I think it was a very interesting transition from competing against a lot of players at Cal before college to then becoming close friends and being on the same team and getting to know them better. I've played a lot of the players on the team competitively before, but I didn't get to know them until I came to Berkeley. And everyone has pretty diverse experiences and goals. Like, we actually have an EECS major who's taking EE courses. Incredible. Probably the only one on campus. And I think it's also really cool that our club is the cheapest sports club and we also take in anyone who wants to join.</p>

          <p>My friends! CalTTC has introduced me to some of my closest friends here at Cal, and every semester I get to meet new interesting people through CalTTC. My academic interests have come and gone, other clubs have come and gone, research has come and gone, and other friends have lost contact but CalTTC is FOREVER. </p>

          <p>There's such a huge range of players, and everyone is extremely welcoming. I've made so many friends through the club, and it's really nice that a lot of people are also CS/EECS, so we can all help each other with classes.</p>
